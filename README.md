# Model Predictive Controllers

This paper describes the application of modern predictive control to develop an active
air braking system for the University of Ottawa rocketry team.

This is a fairly rough-on-the-edges draft of a submission that was made for an
undergraduate course (ie. not for publication). As such, the information
represented may be inaccurate, inconsistent, incomplete or badly written (and it can certainly be a combination of all of the mentioned); we apologize if this is the case.
