Keywordsâ€”Model Predictive Control, Aerospace.  \section{Introduction}

Rockets unlike other aircraft have high speed and dynamic flights, as a result
rocket control systems have to be extremely responsive and precise. Classical
control systems based on observed sensor feedback would not be able to meet the
demands of rocket flight since the latency between plant actuation affecting the
the physical world and detecting that change through sensor observations is too
slow for such dynamic flight enviroments. Model Predictive Control (MPC) solves
these problems by introducing state estimation.  This process involves maintianing
a kenetic

\section{Model Predictive Control}

The complexity of rocket flight partially arises from the numerous states
required to fully define an entire set of dynamics. These states include
acceleration, velocity, position, orientation, angular speed and angular
acceleration of the rocket in all three spatial dimensions. Additionally,
the states related to the actuators (in this case, the servo motor controlling
the airbrakes) must also be considered. Desiging a classical controller or even
a digitally implmented classicial controller would bring along several
inconveniences; for this reason, a model predictive controller was considered
and implemented.

The major concept of model predictive control is to maintain a real time
simulation; This simulation's role is to produce a prediction of future system
states using feedback from sensors and the system's current states. For the case
of achiving a particular target altitude by deploying airbrakes, the MPC will
produce a predicted final altitude every control loop. Using this predicted
final altitude, the error between the predicted final altitude and the desired
final altitude will be calculated. The final part of the MPC process is to map
the calculated error to a specific (whether heuristic or deterministic) control
signal that will be sent to the airbrake actuator.
