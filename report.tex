\begin{abstract}
A simple model predictive control (MPC) schema is described for the appropriate
actuation of custom airbrakes on a sounding rocket for the purposes of achieving
precise final altitude (apogee). The drag characterization of the airbrakes are
briefly mentioned. The overall control systems diagram is presented. The
convenience and flexibility of the MPC schema for a sounding rocket airbrake
system are implicitely given.

\section{Introduction}
Rockets unlike other aircraft have high speed and dynamic flights, as a result
rocket control systems have to be extremely responsive and precise. Classical
control systems based on observed sensor feedback would not be able to meet the
demands of rocket flight since the latency between plant actuation affecting the
the physical world and detecting that change through sensor observations is too
slow for such dynamic flight environments. Model Predictive Control (MPC) solves
these problems by introducing a real time simulation that predicts trajectory.
This process involves maintaining a kinetic model of rocket flight and a
dynamics model of the control surfaces we are using for altitude control.
For the case presented, it is a drag model for a airbrake system.
Using this model we can predict the effect of actuation on the target altitude
via the kinematic model of rocket flight.

\section{System States}
In both classical and MPC design it is important to first outline all the system states.
For most kinetic systems these are the acceleration, velocity and position of the object
being controlled for each axis x, y, z in the state space representation below

\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
\begin{bmatrix}\dot{p_x} \\ \dot{v_x} \\ \dot{a_x} \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}p_x\\v_x\\a_x\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

These vectors need to be projected on a single reference frame, and for the purposes of calculating
rocket trajectory after lift-off and maximum altitude above the ground it makes the most sense to
use the earth as a reference frame.

We also have the additional rotation around each of the specified axis commonly referred to as
pitch roll and yaw

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{./pitch_roll_yaw}
\caption{Rocket Axis of Rotation}
\label{fig:pitch_roll_yaw}
\end{figure}

For simplicity we can omit the roll since it does not contribute to the heading of the rocket in flight.
We can then apply the following reference frame transformation to convert the acceleration experienced
by the rocket to the acceleration it is experiencing with reference to the earth frame using the Euclidian Matrix
\cite{mallick_2016}
\vspace{5mm}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
  \begin{bmatrix}a_x \\ a_y \\ a_z
  \end{bmatrix} =

  \vspace{5mm}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    cos(\theta_x) & sin(\theta_x)sin(\theta_y) & sin(\theta_x)cos(\theta_y) \\
    0 & cos(\theta_y) & -sin(\theta_y) \\
    sin(\theta_y) & cos(\theta_x)sin(\theta_y) & cos(\theta_x)cos(\theta_y) \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} a'_x \\ a'_y \\ a'_z \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Where $\theta_x$ is the yaw and $\theta_y$ is the pitch of the rocket and a' is the acceleration of the rocket
from the rockets reference frame. These form the state space for our rocket system and most 3D kinetic systems

\section{Airbrake Model}
The airbrake is our primary control surface, it is actuated by a servo that deploys
set of fins out of streamlined rocket body.  These can be used to increase the drag on
the rocket body as a result reducing the velocity and final altitude of the rocket.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./airbrake_mechanism}
\caption{Airbrake Mechanism}
\label{fig:airbrake_mechanism}
\end{figure}

The drag force is a function of the surface area and rocket relative velocity as seen below

\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
  F_{drag}(v', A)=\frac{1}{2}C_dv'^2A\rho_{air}
\end{equation}

In order to characterize this system we must determine the drag coefficient of the rocket
during airbrake deployment. Due to the simplicity of the airbrake we can use a basic
model for the experimentally determined drag of a flat plate\cite{nasa} which is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
  C_d=1.28
\end{equation}

But since this drag model will be used to predict the future state of the system, it is
imperative that this model is as representative of the physical world as possible.  Using
a simplistic model is a valid starting point, but using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulations or wind tunnel testing is a recommended continuation argument.

\section{Model Predictive Control}

The complexity of rocket flight partially arises from the numerous states
required to fully define an entire set of dynamics. These states include
acceleration, velocity, position, orientation, angular speed and angular
acceleration of the rocket in all three spatial dimensions. Additionally,
the states related to the actuators (in this case, the servo motor controlling
the airbrakes) must also be considered. Designing a classical controller or even
a digitally implemented classical controller would bring along several
inconveniences; for this reason, a model predictive controller was considered
and implemented.

The major concept of model predictive control is to maintain a real time
simulation; This simulation's role is to produce a prediction of future system
states using feedback from sensors and the system's current states. For the case
of achieving a particular target altitude by deploying airbrakes, the MPC will
produce a predicted final altitude
every control loop. Using this predicted final altitude, the error between the
predicted final altitude and the desired final altitude will be calculated. The
final part of the MPC process is to map the calculated error to a specific
(whether heuristic or deterministic) control signal that will be sent to the
airbrake actuator.

Figure \ref{fig:MPC_diagram} is the fully defined control system diagram
corresponding to the description provided above. Running through the control
schema yields the following sequence of events: sensors are read, filtered and
fused, states are estimated, trajectory is predicted, final altitude error is
determined, control signal is generated, signal is sent to actuator driver,
actuation occurs which affects rocket flight.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./MPC_diagram}
\caption{Overall Control Diagram of airbrake system}
\label{fig:MPC_diagram}
\end{figure}

When comparing figure \ref{fig:MPC_diagram} to a
typical control systems diagram, the input to the system seems to be missing;
This input (the desired final altitude) is merely hidden away as a part of the
digitally implemented configuration values. Some important inferences of the
presented control diagram include understanding that the configuration values
include all physical rocket parameters, as well as the desired final altitude.
Therefore, the presented figure is related more to the physical implementation
than to control theory notation.

\section{Imeplementation}

Here, each block residing within the flight computer as shown in
the diagram presented in figure \ref{fig:MPC_diagram} is
defined further to provide insight into the implementation of this
system.

\subsection{Sensor Fusion}

In order to achieve accurate state estimation, which is an essential functional
component of the control schema, certain feedback values are required in a
non-inertial frame. However the sensors on board the rocket can only measure
quantities in an inertial frame. Therefore, the sensor fusion block is necessary
to not only filter sensor values but also to acquire accurate feedback values in
a non-inertial frame.

To determine what types of filtering and fusion are required, it is helpful to
first determine a set of sensors that will be used. Figure \ref{fig:sensors}
depicts the three main modules of sensors being used. They are, shown left to right,
Yost Labs 3 space LX Embedded IMU, Adafruit MTK3339 GPS and the MPL3115A2 altimeter.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./sensors}
\caption{Image of Sensors Used for System Implementation}
\label{fig:sensors}
\end{figure}

These sensors were chosen to help minimize the amount of self developed fusion and
filtering. The Yost Labs 3 space LX Embedded IMU has nine degrees of freedom and
provides filtered, three dimensional acceleration, speed and position in a
non-inertial frame (via proprietary, low level embedded algorithms). Using the data
from this sensor module, all required feedback values for state estimation can be
satisfied. However to make the state estimation as accurate as possible, the
stand alone GPS and altimeter modules will be used to correct IMU drift and
perform self-checking.

\subsection{State Estimation}

The state estimation block uses the feedback values from sensors (after filtering and fusion)
and the previous states of the system to calculate the current state of the system.
Since the feedback values already provide measured acceleration, speed and position
in a non-inertial frame, they can be used directly to update the states of the system.

\subsection{Final Altitude Prediction}

Recall that equation \ref{eq:3} allows us to model the drag of the rocket given current velocity and
airbrake area. Notice that this is a controllable value based on the airbrake actuation area.  The second
variable is the velocity of the rocket through the relative airflow, this we require us to apply the
inverse of the Euclidian Angle matrix from equation \ref{eq:2} to transform the velocity reference frame
back to that of the rocket (ie. v')

From here we can compute the drag force and apply a ballistic model of rocketry flight that tells us
the maximum altitude of the rocket given its current state and current drag forces. To derive this
we must first find the time at which the vertical velocity $v_{z}$ is zero, by solving the integration of velocity
we can get the predicted distance to this point, and as a result the max altitude

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:6}
\end{equation}

We can use this expression to determine the affect of our air brake deployment on the maximum altitude.

\subsection{Final Altitude Error Calculation}

Using the altitude prediction determined above in equation \ref{eq:4} The error between predicted and desired final altitudes can be computed by:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5}
  error =  y_{z\_target} - y_{z\_max}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Mapping from Error to Control Signal}

\section{Conclusion}

In this brief, an implementation of model predictive control is presented for a
custom airbrake system to be deployed on a sounding rocket. The convenience of
using MPC for this specific application is shown. Furthermore, and with some
modification, it is shown that the implemented MPC can be deployed on cheap electrical
hardware.
